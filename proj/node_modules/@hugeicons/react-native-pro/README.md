## Activate Your License
You have to activate your license key before using Hugeicons React Pro. To do so, you need to import the `hugeiconsLicense` function and call it with your license key as a parameter.

You can do this in your main application file, such as `App.js` or `index.js`:

```jsx
// App.js or index.js
import {hugeiconsLicense} from "@hugeicons/react-native-pro";

hugeiconsLicense('your-license-key-here');
